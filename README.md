Simulates Powerball drawing

This is just a fun test code while I am learning. It only tests for a full winner of Powerball lottery ticket. 

It makes a new ticket and tests it against the winning ticket. It will repeat 1,000,000 times or until a winning ticket is found.

Attempts can be changed to any amount.
